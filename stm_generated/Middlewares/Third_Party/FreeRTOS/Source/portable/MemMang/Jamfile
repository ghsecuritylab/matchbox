Library libstm32_hal :
	#heap_1.c # the very simplest, does not permit memory to be freed
	#heap_2.c # permits memory to be freed, but not does coalescence adjacent free blocks.
	heap_3.c # simply wraps the standard malloc() and free() for thread safety
	#heap_4.c # coalescences adjacent free blocks to avoid fragmentation. Includes absolute address placement option
	#heap_5.c # as heap_4, with the ability to span the heap across multiple non-adjacent memory areas
